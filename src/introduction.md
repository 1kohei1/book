# Tock OS Book

<img src="../imgs/tock.svg" style="float:right;" />
This book introduces you to Tock, a secure embedded operating system for sensor
networks and the Internet of Things. Tock is the first operating system to allow
multiple untrusted applications to run concurrently on a microcontroller-based
computer. The Tock kernel is written in Rust, a memory-safe systems language
that does not rely on a garbage collector. Userspace applications are run in
single-threaded processes that can be written in any language.
