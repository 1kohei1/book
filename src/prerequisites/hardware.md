# Hardware

To complete the hands-on excercises in this guide, you'll need an _imix_
hardware platform (pictured below), a workstation running either Linux or OS X
(you can also work in a [Virtual
Machine](prerequisites/software.html#virtual-machine)), and a micro-USB cable
to connect your imix to your workstation.

To complete the 6LoWPAN networking portion of this guide, you'll need an
additional _imix_ to act as a hub, but multiple participants can use the same
hub _imix_.
